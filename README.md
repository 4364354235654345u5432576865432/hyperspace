This is the official repository for the Hyperspace 1.0 release. This release includes many more changes and will include a redesign that accomodates for desktop and mobile devices.

> Note: This version is _NOT_ production-ready. Rather, this version is under heavy development and will take a while to match feature parity with the current releases of Hyperspace.

If you are looking for the **current** release of Hyperspace, please look at [hyperspace-classic](https://github.com/hyperspacedev/hyperspace-classic).
